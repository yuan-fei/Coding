 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]\n4\n3'
 *
 * You are given an m x n binary matrix grid where each cell is either 0
 * (empty) or 1 (occupied).
 * 
 * You are then given stamps of size stampHeight x stampWidth. We want to fit
 * the stamps such that they follow the given restrictions and
 * requirements:
 * 
 * 
 * Cover all the empty cells.
 * Do not cover any of the occupied cells.
 * We can put as many stamps as we want.
 * Stamps can overlap with each other.
 * Stamps are not allowed to be rotated.
 * Stamps must stay completely inside the grid.
 * 
 * 
 * Return true if it is possible to fit the stamps while following the given
 * restrictions and requirements. Otherwise, return false.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]],
 * stampHeight = 4, stampWidth = 3
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: We have two overlapping stamps (labeled 1 and 2 in the image)
 * that are able to cover all the empty cells.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]], stampHeight = 2,
 * stampWidth = 2 
 * Output: false 
 * Explanation: There is no way to fit the stamps onto all the empty cells
 * without the stamps going outside the grid.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[r].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 10^5
 * 1 <= m * n <= 2 * 10^5
 * grid[r][c] is either 0 or 1.
 * 1 <= stampHeight, stampWidth <= 10^5
 *
