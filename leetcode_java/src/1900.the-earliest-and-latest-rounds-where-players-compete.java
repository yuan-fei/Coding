 * Testcase Example:  '11\n2\n4'
 *
 * There is a tournament where n players are participating. The players are
 * standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial
 * standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the
 * second player in the row, etc.).
 * 
 * The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1).
 * In each round, the i^th player from the front of the row competes against
 * the i^th player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next
 * round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player
 * in the middle automatically advances to the next round.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
 * 
 * 
 * Player 1 competes against player 7.
 * Player 2 competes against player 6.
 * Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on
 * the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).
 * 
 * The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the
 * tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete
 * against each other. If any two other players compete against each other,
 * either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this
 * round.
 * 
 * Given the integers n, firstPlayer, and secondPlayer, return an integer array
 * containing two values, the earliest possible round number and theÂ latest
 * possible round number in which these two players will compete against each
 * other, respectively.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4
 * Output: [3,4]
 * Explanation:
 * One possible scenario which leads to the earliest round number:
 * First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
 * Second round: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11
 * Third round: 2, 3, 4
 * One possible scenario which leads to the latest round number:
 * First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
 * Second round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
 * Third round: 1, 2, 4
 * Fourth round: 2, 4
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 5, firstPlayer = 1, secondPlayer = 5
 * Output: [1,1]
 * Explanation: The players numbered 1 and 5 compete in the first round.
 * There is no way to make them compete in any other round.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 28
 * 1 <= firstPlayer < secondPlayer <= n
 *
