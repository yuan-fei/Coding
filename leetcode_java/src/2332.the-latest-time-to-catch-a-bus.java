 * Testcase Example:  '[10,20]\n[2,17,18,19]\n2'
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array buses of length n, where buses[i]
 * represents the departure time of the i^th bus. You are also given a
 * 0-indexed integer array passengers of length m, where passengers[j]
 * represents the arrival time of the j^th passenger. All bus departure times
 * are unique. All passenger arrival times are unique.
 * 
 * You are given an integer capacity, which represents the maximum number of
 * passengers that can get on each bus.
 * 
 * The passengers will get on the next available bus. You can get on a bus that
 * will depart at x minutes if you arrive at y minutes where y <= x, and the
 * bus is not full. Passengers with the earliest arrival times get on the bus
 * first.
 * 
 * Return the latest time you may arrive at the bus station to catch a bus. You
 * cannot arrive at the same time as another passenger.
 * 
 * Note: The arrays buses and passengers are not necessarily sorted.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: buses = [10,20], passengers = [2,17,18,19], capacity = 2
 * Output: 16
 * Explanation: 
 * The 1^st bus departs with the 1^st passenger. 
 * The 2^nd bus departs with you and the 2^nd passenger.
 * Note that you must not arrive at the same time as the passengers, which is
 * why you must arrive before the 2^nd^ passenger to catch the bus.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: buses = [20,30,10], passengers = [19,13,26,4,25,11,21], capacity = 2
 * Output: 20
 * Explanation: 
 * The 1^st bus departs with the 4^th passenger. 
 * The 2^nd bus departs with the 6^thÂ and 2^nd^ passengers.
 * The 3^rd bus departs with the 1^s^t passenger and you.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == buses.length
 * m == passengers.length
 * 1 <= n, m, capacity <= 10^5
 * 2 <= buses[i], passengers[i] <= 10^9
 * Each element in buses is unique.
 * Each element in passengers is unique.
 *
