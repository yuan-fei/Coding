 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3,2,4]\n[3,1,2,4]'
 *
 * You are given two 0-indexed integer permutations A and B of length n.
 * 
 * A prefix common array of A and B is an array C such that C[i] is equal to
 * the count of numbers that are present at or before the index i in both A and
 * B.
 * 
 * Return the prefix common array of A and B.
 * 
 * A sequence of n integers is called aÂ permutation if it contains all integers
 * from 1 to n exactly once.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
 * Output: [0,2,3,4]
 * Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
 * At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C[1] = 2.
 * At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
 * At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C[3] = 4.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]
 * Output: [0,1,3]
 * Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
 * At i = 1: only 3 is common in A and B, so C[1] = 1.
 * At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= A.length == B.length == n <= 50
 * 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= n
 * It is guaranteed that A and B are both a permutation of n integers.
