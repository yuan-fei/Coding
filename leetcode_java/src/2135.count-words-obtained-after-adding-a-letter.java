 * Testcase Example:  '["ant","act","tack"]\n["tack","act","acti"]'
 *
 * You are given two 0-indexed arrays of strings startWords and targetWords.
 * Each string consists of lowercase English letters only.
 * 
 * For each string in targetWords, check if it is possible to choose a string
 * from startWords and perform a conversion operation on it to be equal to that
 * from targetWords.
 * 
 * The conversion operation is described in the following two steps:
 * 
 * 
 * Append any lowercase letter that is not present in the string to its
 * end.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, if the string is "abc", the letters 'd', 'e', or 'y' can be
 * added to it, but not 'a'. If 'd' is added, the resulting string will be
 * "abcd".
 * 
 * 
 * Rearrange the letters of the new string in any arbitrary order.
 * 
 * For example, "abcd" can be rearranged to "acbd", "bacd", "cbda", and so on.
 * Note that it can also be rearranged to "abcd" itself.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Return the number of strings in targetWords that can be obtained by
 * performing the operations on any string of startWords.
 * 
 * Note that you will only be verifying if the string in targetWords can be
 * obtained from a string in startWords by performing the operations. The
 * strings in startWords do not actually change during this process.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: startWords = ["ant","act","tack"], targetWords =
 * ["tack","act","acti"]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * - In order to form targetWords[0] = "tack", we use startWords[1] = "act",
 * append 'k' to it, and rearrange "actk" to "tack".
 * - There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords[1]
 * = "act".
 * ‚Å† Note that "act" does exist in startWords, but we must append one letter to
 * the string before rearranging it.
 * - In order to form targetWords[2] = "acti", we use startWords[1] = "act",
 * append 'i' to it, and rearrange "acti" to "acti" itself.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: startWords = ["ab","a"], targetWords = ["abc","abcd"]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * - In order to form targetWords[0] = "abc", we use startWords[0] = "ab", add
 * 'c' to it, and rearrange it to "abc".
 * - There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords[1]
 * = "abcd".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= startWords.length, targetWords.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * 1 <= startWords[i].length, targetWords[j].length <= 26
 * Each string of startWords and targetWords consists of lowercase English
 * letters only.
 * No letter occurs more than once in any string of startWords or targetWords.
