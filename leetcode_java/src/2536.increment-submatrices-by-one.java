 * Testcase Example:  '3\n[[1,1,2,2],[0,0,1,1]]'
 *
 * You are given a positive integer n, indicating that we initially have an n x
 * nÂ 0-indexed integer matrix mat filled with zeroes.
 * 
 * You are also given a 2D integer array query. For each query[i] = [row1i,
 * col1i, row2i, col2i], you should do the following operation:
 * 
 * 
 * Add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (row1i,
 * col1i) and the bottom right corner (row2i, col2i). That is, add 1 to
 * mat[x][y] for for all row1i <= x <= row2i and col1i <= y <= col2i.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the matrix mat after performing every query.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, queries = [[1,1,2,2],[0,0,1,1]]
 * Output: [[1,1,0],[1,2,1],[0,1,1]]
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix, the matrix after
 * the first query, and the matrix after the second query.
 * - In the first query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the
 * top left corner (1, 1) and bottom right corner (2, 2).
 * - In the second query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the
 * top left corner (0, 0) and bottom right corner (1, 1).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0,1,1]]
 * Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix and the matrix after
 * the first query.
 * - In the first query we add 1 to every element in the matrix.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 500
 * 1 <= queries.length <= 10^4
 * 0 <= row1i <= row2i < n
 * 0 <= col1i <= col2i < n
 *
