 * Testcase Example:  '"abc"\n"abb"\n"ab"'
 *
 * You are given three strings: s1, s2, and s3. In one operation you can choose
 * one of these strings and delete its rightmost character. Note that you
 * cannot completely empty a string.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal.
 * If it is impossible to make them equal, return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "abb", s3 = "ab"
 * 
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * Explanation:Â Deleting the rightmost character from both s1 and s2 will
 * result in three equal strings.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "dac", s2 = "bac", s3 = "cac"
 * 
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * Explanation: Since the first letters of s1 and s2 differ, they cannot be
 * made equal.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s1.length, s2.length, s3.length <= 100
 * s1, s2 and s3 consist only of lowercase English letters.
