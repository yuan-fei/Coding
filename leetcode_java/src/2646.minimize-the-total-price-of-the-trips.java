 *
 * There exists an undirected and unrooted tree with n nodes indexed from 0 to
 * n - 1. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n
 * - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes
 * ai and bi in the tree.
 * 
 * Each node has an associated price. You are given an integer array price,
 * where price[i] is the price of the i^th node.
 * 
 * The price sum of a given path is the sum of the prices of all nodes lying on
 * that path.
 * 
 * Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array trips, where trips[i] =
 * [starti, endi] indicates that you start the i^th trip from the node starti
 * and travel to the node endi by any path you like.
 * 
 * Before performing your first trip, you can choose some non-adjacent nodes
 * and halve the prices.
 * 
 * Return the minimum total price sum to perform all the given trips.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]], price = [2,2,10,6], trips =
 * [[0,3],[2,1],[2,3]]
 * Output: 23
 * Explanation: The diagram above denotes the tree after rooting it at node 2.
 * The first part shows the initial tree and the second part shows the tree
 * after choosing nodes 0, 2, and 3, and making their price half.
 * For the 1^st trip, we choose path [0,1,3]. The price sum of that path is 1 +
 * 2 + 3 = 6.
 * For the 2^nd trip, we choose path [2,1]. The price sum of that path is 2 + 5
 * = 7.
 * For the 3^rd trip, we choose path [2,1,3]. The price sum of that path is 5 +
 * 2 + 3 = 10.
 * The total price sum of all trips is 6 + 7 + 10 = 23.
 * It can be proven, that 23 is the minimum answer that we can achieve.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], price = [2,2], trips = [[0,0]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The diagram above denotes the tree after rooting it at node 0.
 * The first part shows the initial tree and the second part shows the tree
 * after choosing node 0, and making its price half.
 * For the 1^st trip, we choose path [0]. The price sum of that path is 1.
 * The total price sum of all trips is 1. It can be proven, that 1 is the
 * minimum answer that we can achieve.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 50
 * edges.length == n - 1
 * 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
 * edges represents a valid tree.
 * price.length == n
 * price[i] is an even integer.
 * 1 <= price[i] <= 1000
 * 1 <= trips.length <= 100
 * 0 <= starti, endiÂ <= n - 1
