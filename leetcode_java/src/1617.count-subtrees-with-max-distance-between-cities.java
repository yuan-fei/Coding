 *
 * There are n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are given an array edges of
 * size n-1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] represents a bidirectional edge between
 * cities ui and vi. There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In
 * other words, the cities form a tree.
 * 
 * A subtree is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every
 * other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through
 * only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a
 * city in one subtree that is not present in the other.
 * 
 * For each d from 1 to n-1, find the number of subtrees in which the maximum
 * distance between any two cities in the subtree is equal to d.
 * 
 * Return an array of size n-1 where the d^th element (1-indexed) is the number
 * of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities is equal to
 * d.
 * 
 * Notice that the distance between the two cities is the number of edges in
 * the path between them.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4]]
 * Output: [3,4,0]
 * Explanation:
 * The subtrees with subsets {1,2}, {2,3} and {2,4} have a max distance of 1.
 * The subtrees with subsets {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {2,3,4} and {1,2,3,4} have a max
 * distance of 2.
 * No subtree has two nodes where the max distance between them is 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2, edges = [[1,2]]
 * Output: [1]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,3]]
 * Output: [2,1]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 15
 * edges.length == n-1
 * edges[i].length == 2
 * 1 <= ui, vi <= n
 * All pairs (ui, vi) are distinct.
