 * Testcase Example:  '[[6,10],[5,15]]'
 *
 * You are given a 2D integer array ranges where ranges[i] = [starti, endi]
 * denotes that all integers between starti and endi (both inclusive) are
 * contained in the i^th range.
 * 
 * You are to split ranges into two (possibly empty) groups such that:
 * 
 * 
 * Each range belongs to exactly one group.
 * Any two overlapping ranges must belong to the same group.
 * 
 * 
 * Two ranges are said to be overlappingÂ if there exists at least one integer
 * that is present in both ranges.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, [1, 3] and [2, 5] are overlapping because 2 and 3 occur in both
 * ranges.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the total number of ways to split ranges into two groups. Since the
 * answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ranges = [[6,10],[5,15]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 
 * The two ranges are overlapping, so they must be in the same group.
 * Thus, there are two possible ways:
 * - Put both the ranges together in group 1.
 * - Put both the ranges together in group 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ranges = [[1,3],[10,20],[2,5],[4,8]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 
 * Ranges [1,3], and [2,5] are overlapping. So, they must be in the same group.
 * Again, ranges [2,5] and [4,8] are also overlapping. So, they must also be in
 * the same group. 
 * Thus, there are four possible ways to group them:
 * - All the ranges in group 1.
 * - All the ranges in group 2.
 * - Ranges [1,3], [2,5], and [4,8] in group 1 and [10,20] in group 2.
 * - Ranges [1,3], [2,5], and [4,8] in group 2 and [10,20] in group 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= ranges.length <= 10^5
 * ranges[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^9
 *
