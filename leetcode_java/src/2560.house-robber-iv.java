 *
 * There are several consecutive houses along a street, each of which has some
 * money inside. There is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the
 * homes, but he refuses to steal from adjacent homes.
 * 
 * The capability of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from
 * one house of all the houses he robbed.
 * 
 * You are given an integer array nums representing how much money is stashed
 * in each house. More formally, the i^th house from the left has nums[i]
 * dollars.
 * 
 * You are also given an integer k, representing the minimum number of houses
 * the robber will steal from.Â It is always possible to steal at least k
 * houses.
 * 
 * Return the minimum capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to
 * steal at least k houses.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: 
 * There are three ways to rob at least 2 houses:
 * - Rob the houses at indices 0 and 2. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[2]) =
 * 5.
 * - Rob the houses at indices 0 and 3. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[3]) =
 * 9.
 * - Rob the houses at indices 1 and 3. Capability is max(nums[1], nums[3]) =
 * 9.
 * Therefore, we return min(5, 9, 9) = 5.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1], k = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are 7 ways to rob the houses. The way which leads to
 * minimum capability is to rob the house at index 0 and 4. Return max(nums[0],
 * nums[4]) = 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 * 1 <= k <= (nums.length + 1)/2
 * 
 *
