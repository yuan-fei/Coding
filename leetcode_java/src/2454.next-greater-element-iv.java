 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers nums. For each
 * integer in nums, you must find its respective second greater integer.
 * 
 * The second greater integer of nums[i] is nums[j] such that:
 * 
 * 
 * j > i
 * nums[j] > nums[i]
 * There exists exactly one index k such that nums[k] > nums[i] and i < k <
 * j.
 * 
 * 
 * If there is no such nums[j], the second greater integer is considered to be
 * -1.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, in the array [1, 2, 4, 3], the second greater integer of 1 is
 * 4, 2 is 3,Â and that of 3 and 4 is -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the second greater
 * integer of nums[i].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,4,0,9,6]
 * Output: [9,6,6,-1,-1]
 * Explanation:
 * 0th index: 4 is the first integer greater than 2, and 9 is the second
 * integer greater than 2, to the right of 2.
 * 1st index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 4, to
 * the right of 4.
 * 2nd index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 0, to
 * the right of 0.
 * 3rd index: There is no integer greater than 9 to its right, so the second
 * greater integer is considered to be -1.
 * 4th index: There is no integer greater than 6 to its right, so the second
 * greater integer is considered to be -1.
 * Thus, we return [9,6,6,-1,-1].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,3]
 * Output: [-1,-1]
 * Explanation:
 * We return [-1,-1] since neither integer has any integer greater than it.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 * 
 *
