 * Testcase Example:  '[1,0,0]'
 *
 * We have two special characters:
 * 
 * 
 * The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
 * The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
 * 
 * 
 * Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last
 * character must be a one-bit character.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: bits = [1,0,0]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit
 * character.
 * So the last character is one-bit character.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit
 * character.
 * So the last character is not one-bit character.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= bits.length <= 1000
 * bits[i] is either 0 or 1.
