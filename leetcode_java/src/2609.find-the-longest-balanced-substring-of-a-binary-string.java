 * Testcase Example:  '"01000111"'
 *
 * You are given a binary string s consisting only of zeroes and ones.
 * 
 * A substring of s is considered balanced if all zeroes are before ones and
 * the number of zeroes is equal to the number of ones inside the substring.
 * Notice that the empty substring is considered a balanced substring.
 * 
 * Return the length of the longest balanced substring of s.
 * 
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "01000111"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The longest balanced substring is "000111", which has length
 * 6.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "00111"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest balanced substring is "0011", which has length
 * 4.Â 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "111"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no balanced substring except the empty substring, so
 * the answer is 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 50
 * '0' <= s[i] <= '1'
 * 
 *
