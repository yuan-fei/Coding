 * Testcase Example:  '[[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[4,5]]\n[5,2,5,2,1,1]'
 *
 * There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and rooted
 * at node 0. You are givenÂ a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where
 * edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi
 * in the tree.
 * 
 * You are also given a 0-indexed integer array values of length n, where
 * values[i] is the value associated with the i^th node.
 * 
 * You start with a score of 0. In one operation, you can:
 * 
 * 
 * Pick any node i.
 * Add values[i] to your score.
 * Set values[i] to 0.
 * 
 * 
 * A tree is healthy if the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf
 * node is different than zero.
 * 
 * Return the maximum score you can obtain after performing these operations on
 * the tree any number of times so that it remains healthy.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[4,5]], values = [5,2,5,2,1,1]
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation: We can choose nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The value of the root is
 * non-zero. Hence, the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf is
 * different than zero. Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is
 * values[1] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] + values[5] = 11.
 * It can be shown that 11 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of
 * operations on the tree.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values =
 * [20,10,9,7,4,3,5]
 * Output: 40
 * Explanation: We can choose nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
 * - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 4 is equal to 10.
 * - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 3 is equal to 10.
 * - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 5 is equal to 3.
 * - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 6 is equal to 5.
 * Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[0] + values[2] +
 * values[3] + values[4] = 40.
 * It can be shown that 40 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of
 * operations on the tree.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
 * edges.length == n - 1
 * edges[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= ai, bi < n
 * values.length == n
 * 1 <= values[i] <= 10^9
 * The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.
