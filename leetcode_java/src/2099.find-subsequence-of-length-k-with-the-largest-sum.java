 *
 * You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You want to find a
 * subsequence of nums of length k that has the largest sum.
 * 
 * Return any such subsequence as an integer array of length k.
 * 
 * A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting
 * some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2
 * Output: [3,3]
 * Explanation:
 * The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [-1,-2,3,4], k = 3
 * Output: [-1,3,4]
 * Explanation: 
 * The subsequence has the largest sum of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,4,3,3], k = 2
 * Output: [3,4]
 * Explanation:
 * The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 4 = 7. 
 * Another possible subsequence is [4, 3].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * -10^5Â <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 * 1 <= k <= nums.length
 *
