 *
 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
 * sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
 * transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in
 * the same or another computer environment.
 * 
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
 * restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
 * You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
 * this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 * 
 * Example: 
 * 
 * 
 * You may serialize the following tree:
 * 
 * ⁠   1
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 2   3
 * ⁠    / \
 * ⁠   4   5
 * 
 * as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
 * 
 * 
 * Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a
 * binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be
 * creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
 * 
 * Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your
 * serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
