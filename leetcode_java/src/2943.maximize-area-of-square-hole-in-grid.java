 * Testcase Example:  '2\n1\n[2,3]\n[2]'
 *
 * You are given the two integers, n and m and two integer arrays, hBars and
 * vBars. The grid has n + 2 horizontal and m + 2 vertical bars, creating 1 x 1
 * unit cells. The bars are indexed starting from 1.
 * 
 * You can remove some of the bars in hBars from horizontal bars and some of
 * the bars in vBars from vertical bars. Note that other bars are fixed and
 * cannot be removed.
 * 
 * Return an integer denoting the maximum area of a square-shaped hole in the
 * grid, after removing some bars (possibly none).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2, m = 1, hBars = [2,3], vBars = [2]
 * 
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * The left image shows the initial grid formed by the bars. The horizontal
 * bars are [1,2,3,4], and the vertical bars areÂ [1,2,3].
 * 
 * One way to get the maximum square-shaped hole is by removing horizontal bar
 * 2 and vertical bar 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1, m = 1, hBars = [2], vBars = [2]
 * 
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * To get the maximum square-shaped hole, we remove horizontal bar 2 and
 * vertical bar 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2, m = 3, hBars = [2,3], vBars = [2,4]
 * 
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * One way to get the maximum square-shaped hole is by removing horizontal bar
 * 3, and vertical bar 4.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 10^9
 * 1 <= m <= 10^9
 * 1 <= hBars.length <= 100
 * 2 <= hBars[i] <= n + 1
 * 1 <= vBars.length <= 100
 * 2 <= vBars[i] <= m + 1
 * All values in hBars are distinct.
 * All values in vBars are distinct.
