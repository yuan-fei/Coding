 *
 * 
 * The set S originally contains numbers from 1 to n. But unfortunately, due to
 * the data error, one of the numbers in the set got duplicated to another
 * number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of
 * another number. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Given an array nums representing the data status of this set after the
 * error. Your task is to firstly find the number occurs twice and then find
 * the number that is missing. Return them in the form of an array.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
 * Output: [2,3]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The given array size will in the range [2, 10000].
 * The given array's numbers won't have any order.
