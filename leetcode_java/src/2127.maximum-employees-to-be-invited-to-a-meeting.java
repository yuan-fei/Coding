 * Testcase Example:  '[2,2,1,2]'
 *
 * A company is organizing a meeting and has a list of n employees, waiting to
 * be invited. They have arranged for a large circular table, capable of
 * seating any number of employees.
 * 
 * The employees are numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each employee has a favorite
 * person and they will attend the meeting only if they can sit next to their
 * favorite person at the table. The favorite person of an employee is not
 * themself.
 * 
 * Given a 0-indexed integer array favorite, where favorite[i] denotes the
 * favorite person of the i^th employee, return the maximum number of employees
 * that can be invited to the meeting.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: favorite = [2,2,1,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * The above figure shows how the company can invite employees 0, 1, and 2, and
 * seat them at the round table.
 * All employees cannot be invited because employee 2 cannot sit beside
 * employees 0, 1, and 3, simultaneously.
 * Note that the company can also invite employees 1, 2, and 3, and give them
 * their desired seats.
 * The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 3. 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: favorite = [1,2,0]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 
 * Each employee is the favorite person of at least one other employee, and the
 * only way the company can invite them is if they invite every employee.
 * The seating arrangement will be the same as that in the figure given in
 * example 1:
 * - Employee 0 will sit between employees 2 and 1.
 * - Employee 1 will sit between employees 0 and 2.
 * - Employee 2 will sit between employees 1 and 0.
 * The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: favorite = [3,0,1,4,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation:
 * The above figure shows how the company will invite employees 0, 1, 3, and 4,
 * and seat them at the round table.
 * Employee 2 cannot be invited because the two spots next to their favorite
 * employee 1 are taken.
 * So the company leaves them out of the meeting.
 * The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 4.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == favorite.length
 * 2 <= n <= 10^5
 * 0 <= favorite[i] <=Â n - 1
 * favorite[i] != i
 *
