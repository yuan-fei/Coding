 *
 * There is a country of n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 where all the cities
 * are connected by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D
 * integer array edges where edges[i] = [xi, yi, timei] denotes a road between
 * cities xi and yi that takes timei minutes to travel. There may be multiple
 * roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road
 * connects a city to itself.
 * 
 * Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is
 * represented as a 0-indexed integer array passingFees of length n where
 * passingFees[j] is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through
 * city j.
 * 
 * In the beginning, you are at city 0 and want to reach city n - 1 in maxTime
 * minutes or less. The cost of your journey is the summation of passing fees
 * for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey
 * (including the source and destination cities).
 * 
 * Given maxTime, edges, and passingFees, return the minimum cost to complete
 * your journey, or -1 if you cannot complete it within maxTime minutes.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: maxTime = 30, edges =
 * [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees =
 * [5,1,2,20,20,3]
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation: The path to take is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5, which takes 30 minutes
 * and has $11 worth of passing fees.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: maxTime = 29, edges =
 * [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees =
 * [5,1,2,20,20,3]
 * Output: 48
 * Explanation: The path to take is 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which takes 26 minutes
 * and has $48 worth of passing fees.
 * You cannot take path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 since it would take too long.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: maxTime = 25, edges =
 * [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees =
 * [5,1,2,20,20,3]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There is no way to reach city 5 from city 0 within 25
 * minutes.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= maxTime <= 1000
 * n == passingFees.length
 * 2 <= n <= 1000
 * n - 1 <= edges.length <= 1000
 * 0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1
 * 1 <= timei <= 1000
 * 1 <= passingFees[j] <= 1000Â 
 * The graph may contain multiple edges between two nodes.
 * The graph does not contain self loops.
