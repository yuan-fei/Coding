 * Testcase Example:  '3\n[[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]]\n[0.5,0.5,0.2]\n0\n2'
 *
 * You are given an undirected weighted graph of n nodes (0-indexed),
 * represented by an edge list where edges[i] = [a, b] is an undirected edge
 * connecting the nodes a and b with a probability of success of traversing
 * that edge succProb[i].
 * 
 * Given two nodes start and end, find the path with the maximum probability of
 * success to go from start to end and return its success probability.
 * 
 * If there is no path from start to end, return 0. Your answer will be
 * accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most 1e-5.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start =
 * 0, end = 2
 * Output: 0.25000
 * Explanation: There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability
 * of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start =
 * 0, end = 2
 * Output: 0.30000
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1]], succProb = [0.5], start = 0, end = 2
 * Output: 0.00000
 * Explanation: There is no path between 0 and 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 10^4
 * 0 <= start, end < n
 * start != end
 * 0 <= a, b < n
 * a != b
 * 0 <= succProb.length == edges.length <= 2*10^4
 * 0 <= succProb[i] <= 1
 * There is at most one edge between every two nodes.
