 *
 * You are given an array points, an integer angle, and your location, where
 * location = [posx, posy] and points[i] = [xi, yi] both denote integral
 * coordinates on the X-Y plane.
 * 
 * Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You cannot move
 * from your position, but you can rotate. In other words, posx and posy cannot
 * be changed. Your field of view in degrees is represented by angle,
 * determiningÂ how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let d be the
 * amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view
 * is the inclusive range of angles [d - angle/2, d + angle/2].

 * 
 * You can see some set of points if, for each point, the angle formed by the
 * point, your position, and the immediate east direction from your position is
 * in your field of view.
 * 
 * There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your
 * location, and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation.
 * Points do not obstruct your vision to other points.
 * 
 * Return the maximum number of points you can see.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,3]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The shaded region represents your field of view. All points can
 * be made visible in your field of view, including [3,3] even though [2,2] is
 * in front and in the same line of sight.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: All points can be made visible in your field of view, including
 * the one at your location.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: points = [[1,0],[2,1]], angle = 13, location = [1,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: You can only see one of the two points, as shown above.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= points.length <= 10^5
 * points[i].length == 2
 * location.length == 2
 * 0 <= angle < 360
 * 0 <= posx, posy, xi, yi <= 10^9
 *
