 *
 * There is an m x n cake that needs to be cut into 1 x 1 pieces.
 * 
 * You are given integers m, n, and two arrays:
 * 
 * 
 * horizontalCut of size m - 1, where horizontalCut[i] represents the cost to
 * cut along the horizontal line i.
 * verticalCut of size n - 1, where verticalCut[j] represents the cost to cut
 * along the vertical line j.
 * 
 * 
 * In one operation, you can choose any piece of cake that is not yet a 1 x 1
 * square and perform one of the following cuts:
 * 
 * 
 * Cut along a horizontal line i at a cost of horizontalCut[i].
 * Cut along a vertical line j at a cost of verticalCut[j].
 * 
 * 
 * After the cut, the piece of cake is divided into two distinct pieces.
 * 
 * The cost of a cut depends only on the initial cost of the line and does not
 * change.
 * 
 * Return the minimum total cost to cut the entire cake into 1 x 1 pieces.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: m = 3, n = 2, horizontalCut = [1,3], verticalCut = [5]
 * 
 * Output: 13
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 with cost 5, current total cost is
 * 5.
 * Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 on 3 x 1 subgrid with cost 1.
 * Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 on 3 x 1 subgrid with cost 1.
 * Perform a cut on the horizontal line 1 on 2 x 1 subgrid with cost 3.
 * Perform a cut on the horizontal line 1 on 2 x 1 subgrid with cost 3.
 * 
 * 
 * The total cost is 5 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 13.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: m = 2, n = 2, horizontalCut = [7], verticalCut = [4]
 * 
 * Output: 15
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * 
 * Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 with cost 7.
 * Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 on 1 x 2 subgrid with cost 4.
 * Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 on 1 x 2 subgrid with cost 4.
 * 
 * 
 * The total cost is 7 + 4 + 4 = 15.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= m, n <= 10^5
 * horizontalCut.length == m - 1
 * verticalCut.length == n - 1
 * 1 <= horizontalCut[i], verticalCut[i] <= 10^3
 *
