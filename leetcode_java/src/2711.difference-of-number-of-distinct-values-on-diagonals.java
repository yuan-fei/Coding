 *
 * Given a 0-indexed 2D grid of size m x n, you should find the matrix answer
 * of size m x n.
 * 
 * The value of each cell (r, c) of the matrix answer is calculated in the
 * following way:
 * 
 * 
 * Let topLeft[r][c] be the number of distinct values in the top-left diagonal
 * of the cell (r, c) in the matrix grid.
 * Let bottomRight[r][c] be the number of distinct values in the bottom-right
 * diagonal of the cell (r, c) in the matrix grid.
 * 
 * 
 * Then answer[r][c] = |topLeft[r][c] - bottomRight[r][c]|.
 * 
 * Return the matrix answer.
 * 
 * A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in
 * either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right
 * direction until reaching the matrix's end.
 * 
 * A cell (r1, c1) belongs to the top-left diagonal of the cell (r, c), if both
 * belong to the same diagonal and r1 < r. Similarly is defined bottom-right
 * diagonal.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[3,1,5],[3,2,1]]
 * Output: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1]]
 * Explanation: The 1^st diagram denotes the initial grid.Â 
 * The 2^nd diagram denotes a grid for cell (0,0), where blue-colored cells are
 * cells on its bottom-right diagonal.
 * The 3^rd diagram denotes a grid for cell (1,2), where red-colored cells are
 * cells on its top-left diagonal.
 * The 4^th diagram denotes a grid for cell (1,1), where blue-colored cells are
 * cells on its bottom-right diagonal and red-colored cells are cells on its
 * top-left diagonal.
 * - The cell (0,0) contains [1,1] on its bottom-right diagonal and [] on its
 * top-left diagonal. The answer is |1 - 0| = 1.
 * - The cell (1,2) contains [] on its bottom-right diagonal and [2] on its
 * top-left diagonal. The answer is |0 - 1| = 1.
 * - The cell (1,1) contains [1] on its bottom-right diagonal and [1] on its
 * top-left diagonal. The answer is |1 - 1| = 0.
 * The answers of other cells are similarly calculated.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[1]]
 * Output: [[0]]
 * Explanation: - The cell (0,0) contains [] on its bottom-right diagonal and
 * [] on its top-left diagonal. The answer is |0 - 0| = 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n, grid[i][j] <= 50
 *
