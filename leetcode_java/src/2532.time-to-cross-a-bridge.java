 *
 * There are k workers who want to move n boxes from an old warehouse to a new
 * one. You are given the two integers n and k, and a 2D integer array time of
 * size k x 4 where time[i] = [leftToRighti, pickOldi, rightToLefti, putNewi].
 * 
 * The warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge. The old
 * warehouse is on the right bank of the river, and the new warehouse is on the
 * left bank of the river. Initially, all k workers are waiting on the left
 * side of the bridge. To move the boxes, the i^th worker (0-indexed) can
 * :
 * 
 * 
 * Cross the bridge from the left bank (new warehouse) to the right bank (old
 * warehouse) in leftToRighti minutes.
 * Pick a box from the old warehouse and return to the bridge in pickOldi
 * minutes. Different workers can pick up their boxes simultaneously.
 * Cross the bridge from the right bank (old warehouse) to the left bank (new
 * warehouse) in rightToLefti minutes.
 * Put the box in the new warehouse and return to the bridge in putNewi
 * minutes. Different workers can put their boxes simultaneously.
 * 
 * 
 * A worker i is less efficient than a worker j if either condition is
 * met:
 * 
 * 
 * leftToRighti + rightToLefti > leftToRightj + rightToLeftj
 * leftToRighti + rightToLefti == leftToRightj + rightToLeftj and i > j
 * 
 * 
 * The following rules regulate the movement of the workers through the bridge
 * :
 * 
 * 
 * If a worker x reaches the bridge while another worker y is crossing the
 * bridge, x waits at their side of the bridge.
 * If the bridge is free, the worker waiting on the right side of the bridge
 * gets to cross the bridge. If more than one worker is waiting on the right
 * side, the one with the lowest efficiency crosses first.
 * If the bridge is free and no worker is waiting on the right side, and at
 * least one box remains at the old warehouse, the worker on the left side of
 * the river gets to cross the bridge. If more than one worker is waiting on
 * the left side, the one with the lowest efficiency crosses first.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the instance of time at which the last worker reaches the left bank
 * of the river after all n boxes have been put in the new warehouse.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1, k = 3, time = [[1,1,2,1],[1,1,3,1],[1,1,4,1]]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: 
 * From 0 to 1: worker 2 crosses the bridge from the left bank to the right
 * bank.
 * From 1 to 2: worker 2 picks up a box from the old warehouse.
 * From 2 to 6: worker 2 crosses the bridge from the right bank to the left
 * bank.
 * From 6 to 7: worker 2 puts a box at the new warehouse.
 * The whole process ends after 7 minutes. We return 6 because the problem asks
 * for the instance of time at which the last worker reaches the left bank.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, k = 2, time = [[1,9,1,8],[10,10,10,10]]
 * Output: 50
 * Explanation: 
 * From 0 Â to 10: worker 1 crosses the bridge from the left bank to the right
 * bank.
 * From 10 to 20: worker 1 picks up a box from the old warehouse.
 * From 10 to 11: worker 0 crosses the bridge from the left bank to the right
 * bank.
 * From 11 to 20: worker 0 picks up a box from the old warehouse.
 * From 20 to 30: worker 1 crosses the bridge from the right bank to the left
 * bank.
 * From 30 to 40: worker 1 puts a box at the new warehouse.
 * From 30 to 31: worker 0 crosses the bridge from the right bank to the left
 * bank.
 * From 31 to 39: worker 0 puts a box at the new warehouse.
 * From 39 to 40: worker 0 crosses the bridge from the left bank to the right
 * bank.
 * From 40 to 49: worker 0 picks up a box from the old warehouse.
 * From 49 to 50: worker 0 crosses the bridge from the right bank to the left
 * bank.
 * From 50 to 58: worker 0 puts a box at the new warehouse.
 * The whole process ends after 58 minutes. We return 50 because the problem
 * asks for the instance of time at which the last worker reaches the left
 * bank.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n, k <= 10^4
 * time.length == k
 * time[i].length == 4
 * 1 <= leftToRighti, pickOldi, rightToLefti, putNewi <= 1000
 *
