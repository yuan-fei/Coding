 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. A pair of indices i, j where 0
 * <=Â i < j < nums.length is called beautiful if the first digit of nums[i] and
 * the last digit of nums[j] are coprime.
 * 
 * Return the total number of beautiful pairs in nums.
 * 
 * Two integers x and y are coprime if there is no integer greater than 1 that
 * divides both of them. In other words, x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1,
 * where gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,5,1,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: There are 5 beautiful pairs in nums:
 * When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of
 * nums[1] is 5. We can confirm that 2 and 5 are coprime, since gcd(2,5) == 1.
 * When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of
 * nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(2,1) == 1.
 * When i = 1 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of
 * nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(5,1) == 1.
 * When i = 1 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of
 * nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(5,4) == 1.
 * When i = 2 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[2] is 1, and the last digit of
 * nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(1,4) == 1.
 * Thus, we return 5.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [11,21,12]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are 2 beautiful pairs:
 * When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of
 * nums[1] is 1. Indeed, gcd(1,1) == 1.
 * When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of
 * nums[2] is 2. Indeed, gcd(1,2) == 1.
 * Thus, we return 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= nums.length <= 100
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 9999
 * nums[i] % 10 != 0
 *
