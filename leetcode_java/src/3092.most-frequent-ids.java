 *
 * The problem involves tracking the frequency of IDs in a collection that
 * changes over time. You have two integer arrays, nums and freq, of equal
 * length n. Each element in nums represents an ID, and the corresponding
 * element in freq indicates how many times that ID should be added to or
 * removed from the collection at each step.
 * 
 * 
 * Addition of IDs: If freq[i] is positive, it means freq[i] IDs with the value
 * nums[i] are added to the collection at step i.
 * Removal of IDs: If freq[i] is negative, it means -freq[i] IDs with the value
 * nums[i] are removed from the collection at step i.
 * 
 * 
 * Return an array ans of length n, where ans[i] represents the count of the
 * most frequent ID in the collection after the i^thÂ step. If the collection is
 * empty at any step, ans[i] should be 0 for that step.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,3,2,1], freq = [3,2,-3,1]
 * 
 * Output: [3,3,2,2]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * After step 0, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2. So ans[0] = 3.
 * After step 1, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2 and 2 IDs with the value of
 * 3. So ans[1] = 3.
 * After step 2, we have 2 IDs with the value of 3. So ans[2] = 2.
 * After step 3, we have 2 IDs with the value of 3 and 1 ID with the value of
 * 1. So ans[3] = 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [5,5,3], freq = [2,-2,1]
 * 
 * Output: [2,0,1]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * After step 0, we have 2 IDs with the value of 5. So ans[0] = 2.
 * After step 1, there are no IDs. So ans[1] = 0.
 * After step 2, we have 1 ID with the value of 3. So ans[2] = 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length == freq.length <= 10^5
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 * -10^5 <= freq[i] <= 10^5
 * freq[i] != 0
 * The input is generated such that the occurrences of an ID will not be
 * negative in any step.
