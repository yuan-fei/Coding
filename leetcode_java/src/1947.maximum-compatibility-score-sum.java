 *
 * There is a survey that consists of n questions where each question's answer
 * is either 0 (no) or 1 (yes).
 * 
 * The survey was given to m students numbered from 0 to m - 1 and m mentors
 * numbered from 0 to m - 1. The answers of the students are represented by a
 * 2D integer array students where students[i] is an integer array that
 * contains the answers of the i^th student (0-indexed). The answers of the
 * mentors are represented by a 2D integer array mentors where mentors[j] is an
 * integer array that contains the answers of the j^th mentor (0-indexed).
 * 
 * Each student will be assigned to one mentor, and each mentor will have one
 * student assigned to them. The compatibility score of a student-mentor pair
 * is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the
 * mentor.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, if the student's answers were [1, 0, 1] and the mentor's
 * answers were [0, 0, 1], then their compatibility score is 2 because only the
 * second and the third answers are the same.
 * 
 * 
 * You are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to maximize
 * the sum of the compatibility scores.
 * 
 * Given students and mentors, return the maximum compatibility score sum that
 * can be achieved.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: students = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]], mentors =
 * [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation:Â We assign students to mentors in the following way:
 * - student 0 to mentor 2 with a compatibility score of 3.
 * - student 1 to mentor 0 with a compatibility score of 2.
 * - student 2 to mentor 1 with a compatibility score of 3.
 * The compatibility score sum is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: students = [[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]], mentors = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The compatibility score of any student-mentor pair is 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * m == students.length == mentors.length
 * n == students[i].length == mentors[j].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 8
 * students[i][k] is either 0 or 1.
 * mentors[j][k] is either 0 or 1.
