 * Testcase Example:  '4\n[[2,0],[2,1],[1,3]]'
 *
 * There is a simple directed graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. The
 * graph would form a tree if its edges were bi-directional.
 * 
 * You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] =
 * [ui, vi] represents a directed edge going from node ui to node vi.
 * 
 * An edge reversal changes the direction of an edge, i.e., a directed edge
 * going from node ui to node vi becomes a directed edge going from node vi to
 * node ui.
 * 
 * For every node i in the range [0, n - 1], your task is to independently
 * calculate the minimum number of edge reversals required so it is possible to
 * reach any other node starting from node i through a sequence of directed
 * edges.
 * 
 * Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the  minimum number of
 * edge reversals required so it is possible to reach any other node starting
 * from node i through a sequence of directed edges.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[1,3]]
 * Output: [1,1,0,2]
 * Explanation: The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
 * For node 0: after reversing the edge [2,0], it is possible to reach any
 * other node starting from node 0.
 * So, answer[0] = 1.
 * For node 1: after reversing the edge [2,1], it is possible to reach any
 * other node starting from node 1.
 * So, answer[1] = 1.
 * For node 2: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from
 * node 2.
 * So, answer[2] = 0.
 * For node 3: after reversing the edges [1,3] and [2,1], it is possible to
 * reach any other node starting from node 3.
 * So, answer[3] = 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,0]]
 * Output: [2,0,1]
 * Explanation: The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
 * For node 0: after reversing the edges [2,0] and [1,2], it is possible to
 * reach any other node starting from node 0.
 * So, answer[0] = 2.
 * For node 1: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from
 * node 1.
 * So, answer[1] = 0.
 * For node 2: after reversing the edge [1, 2], it is possible to reach any
 * other node starting from node 2.
 * So, answer[2] = 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 10^5
 * edges.length == n - 1
 * edges[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= ui == edges[i][0] < n
 * 0 <= vi == edges[i][1] < n
 * ui != vi
 * The input is generated suchÂ that if the edges were bi-directional, the graph
 * would be a tree.
