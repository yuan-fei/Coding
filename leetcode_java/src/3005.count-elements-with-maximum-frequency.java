 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,2,3,1,4]'
 *
 * You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.
 * 
 * Return the total frequencies of elements in numsÂ such that those elements
 * all have the maximum frequency.
 * 
 * The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in
 * the array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum
 * frequency in the array.
 * So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the
 * maximum.
 * So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 100
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
 *
