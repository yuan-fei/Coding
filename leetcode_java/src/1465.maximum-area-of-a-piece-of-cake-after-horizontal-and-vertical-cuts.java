 * Testcase Example:  '5\n4\n[1,2,4]\n[1,3]'
 *
 * Given a rectangular cake with height h and width w, and two arrays of
 * integers horizontalCuts and verticalCuts where horizontalCuts[i] is the
 * distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut and
 * similarly, verticalCuts[j] is the distance from the left of the rectangular
 * cake to the jth vertical cut.
 * 
 * Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal
 * and vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalCuts and
 * verticalCuts. Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9
 * + 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [1,2,4], verticalCuts = [1,3]
 * Output: 4 
 * Explanation: The figure above represents the given rectangular cake. Red
 * lines are the horizontal and vertical cuts. After you cut the cake, the
 * green piece of cake has the maximum area.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3,1], verticalCuts = [1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The figure above represents the given rectangular cake. Red
 * lines are the horizontal and vertical cuts. After you cut the cake, the
 * green and yellow pieces of cake have the maximum area.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3], verticalCuts = [3]
 * Output: 9
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= h, w <= 10^9
 * 1 <= horizontalCuts.length < min(h, 10^5)
 * 1 <= verticalCuts.length < min(w, 10^5)
 * 1 <= horizontalCuts[i] < h
 * 1 <= verticalCuts[i] < w
 * It is guaranteed that all elements in horizontalCuts are distinct.
 * It is guaranteed that all elements in verticalCuts are distinct.
